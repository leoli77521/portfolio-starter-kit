## Freshness Requirements

### Data Age Priority
```
2026        ████████████ Strongly Preferred
2025        ██████████   Preferred
2024        ██████       Acceptable
2023        ████         Use with caution
Pre-2023    ██           Only for historical context
```

### Handling Dated Data
When only older data is available:
1. Note the publication date explicitly
2. Search for more recent corroborating data
3. Use hedging language: "As of 2024...", "Recent data suggests..."
4. Look for trend indicators that may still apply
