# GPT-5 for Coding: Benchmarks & Pricing

**Description:** GPT-5 finally ships with real gains in coding. Here‚Äôs what the benchmarks actually mean, what it costs, the catches, and five tips to get better results.

---

If you missed the livestream (and the‚Ä¶ ‚Äúcreative‚Äù charts), here‚Äôs the short of it: GPT-5 is out, it‚Äôs fast, and‚Äîcrucially‚Äîit‚Äôs **better at real code** than earlier models. There‚Äôs legit signal in the numbers, plus a few launch-week faceplants worth knowing about. ([Business Insider][1])

## What the numbers actually say (and why they matter)

* **Real-repo bug fixing (SWE-bench Verified): 74.9%.** This benchmark gives a model a real GitHub repo + issue and counts it as a win only if its patch passes the tests. GPT-5 sets the new top score here. Translation: it‚Äôs not just autocomplete; it can land fixes that compile and pass. ([OpenAI][2], [swebench.com][3])
* **Code-editing (Aider Polyglot): 88%.** This one measures whether the model can reliably produce correct **diffs/whole-file edits** across tough Exercism problems in multiple languages. High scores here usually mean fewer malformed patches and less babysitting in your editor. ([OpenAI][2], [aider.chat][4])
* **Efficiency vs. o3 on tough tasks:** OpenAI reports GPT-5 hits those results with **~22% fewer output tokens** and **~45% fewer tool calls** (at comparable high-reasoning settings). That matters for both latency and your cloud bill. ([OpenAI][5])

> Nerd note: SWE-bench Verified is a **500-task** human-filtered slice of real issues; OpenAI says 23 tasks were omitted in their run due to infra quirks‚Äîso don‚Äôt compare raw percentages without reading footnotes. ([swebench.com][6], [OpenAI][5])

## How this shows up in your editor

OpenAI says GPT-5 is now the **default model in ChatGPT** for signed-in users, with a beefier ‚ÄúGPT-5 Thinking‚Äù toggle for harder prompts. There‚Äôs also a **real-time router** that decides when to think longer vs. answer quickly‚Äîuseful in theory, but you can also force deep-thinking by literally asking it to ‚Äú**think hard about this**.‚Äù ([OpenAI][7])

For developers, the API variant is tuned for **agentic coding** (tool use, multi-step plans) and was tested with popular coding tools (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, etc.). This is where that ‚Äúfewer tool calls, better results‚Äù claim should shine. ([OpenAI][5])

## Pricing in plain English

* **GPT-5 API:** **$1.25** per 1M input tokens; **$10** per 1M output tokens; cached input **$0.125** per 1M.
* **GPT-5 mini / nano** exist if you need cheaper & faster for simpler jobs.
  (And yes, GPT-5 is rolling out across ChatGPT‚Äîfree and paid‚Äîwith tiered limits.) ([OpenAI][8])

## Reality check: it‚Äôs not all roses üåπ

* The launch demo had some‚Ä¶ **chart crimes** (OpenAI acknowledged and fixed them). If you felt gaslit by bar lengths, you weren‚Äôt alone. ([Business Insider][1])
* In the wild, **routing can misfire** and GPT-5 will still bungle basics now and then (spelling, geography‚Äîyikes). It‚Äôs powerful, not perfect. ([Âç´Êä•][9])

## Five quick tips to actually get better code out of GPT-5

1. **Say the magic words:** add ‚Äú**think hard about this**‚Äù (or pick GPT-5 Thinking) for cross-file refactors, gnarly bugs, or green-field scaffolding. ([OpenAI][7])
2. **Feed it the right context:** repo map, key files, failing tests, and error traces. These benchmarks reward realistic setup for a reason. ([swebench.com][3])
3. **Ask for diffs + self-checks:** request `git diff`/patch format and a post-patch test run plan. That mirrors how it wins on Aider & SWE-bench. ([OpenAI][2], [aider.chat][4])
4. **Let it use tools, but audit results:** the model‚Äôs better at chaining steps with fewer calls‚Äîstill review the plan like you would a junior dev‚Äôs. ([OpenAI][5])
5. **Mind your tokens:** long ‚Äúthinky‚Äù answers are pricey; use them where they pay off (architecture, debugging), not for renaming variables. ([OpenAI][5])

## So‚Ä¶ is GPT-5 ‚Äúgood at programming‚Äù?

Short answer: **Yes‚Äîbest-in-class on real-world code benchmarks right now**, with practical gains in stability and tool use. It won‚Äôt replace tests, code review, or your taste in API design‚Äîbut it **will** ship more fixes on the first try and waste fewer cycles doing it. And with **ChatGPT nearing 700M weekly users**, expect your teammates (and competitors) to be piloting it soon. ([OpenAI][2])
