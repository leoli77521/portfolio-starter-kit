# Spaces vs Tabs: Developer Ergonomics and Toolchain Reality

*How to make a style decision that keeps code readable, inclusive, and automation-friendly*

## The Debate Is Still Alive

Every onboarding call still has that moment: someone asks whether the team prefers spaces or tabs and the room goes quiet. The debate is no longer ideological; the tooling we ship determines how accessible our code is, how clean our diffs look, and how predictable our automated migrations become.

The goal of this guide is simple: give you a repeatable framework you can paste into your engineering handbook so that the "spaces vs tabs" question stops costing you sprint time.

## Key Criteria That Should Drive the Decision

1. **Accessibility requirements** - Screen readers and monospace fonts behave differently with tab stops.
2. **Diff stability** - CI bots and reviewers prefer deterministic formatting to avoid noisy PRs.
3. **Language ecosystem defaults** - Go, Python, and Rust toolchains all ship with opinions baked in.
4. **Legacy footprint** - You may have tens of thousands of lines already formatted one way.
5. **Editor support** - Developers still toggle between VS Code, JetBrains, and Vim on the same repo.

## What the Toolchain Vendors Default To

| Language / Ecosystem | Official Formatter | Default Indent | Override Options |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | Prettier | 2 spaces | `tabWidth`, `useTabs` |
| Python | Black | 4 spaces | None (tabs rejected) |
| Go | gofmt | Tabs | Rare overrides via `gofmt -tabs=false` |
| Rust | rustfmt | 4 spaces | Unstable config required |
| C# | dotnet-format | 4 spaces | `.editorconfig` |

If you align with the ecosystem defaults, you get free upgrades every time the formatter adds a rule. Fighting the defaults means carrying custom config in perpetuity.

## Accessibility and Screen Reader Considerations

- Tabs render at variable widths depending on user settings. This is great for power users but confusing for screen readers that expect uniform spacing.
- Spaces provide deterministic layout for Braille displays and speech synthesis because each space is announced consistently.
- For mixed-ability teams, the safest choice is spaces for indentation and tabs reserved for alignment in data tables where flexibility matters.

## Diff Hygiene: How Reviewers Experience Your Choice

Consider a TypeScript file where a developer adds two guard clauses. With tabs configured at 4 spaces, a reviewer using an 80-column Git console might see the entire diff realign. Spaces keep the diff localized.

```typescript
if (!user?.profile) {
  return redirect('/login')
}

if (!user.isOnboarded) {
  return redirect('/welcome')
}
```

The snippet above with spaces produces a tiny diff because every formatter agrees on the exact number of characters. Tabs often widen or shrink based on local editor settings, producing "phantom" changes on unrelated lines.

## The Hybrid Pattern That Works in 2025

A practical compromise adopted by many product teams:

- **Indentation:** Use spaces (2 or 4) enforced by your formatter.
- **Alignment:** Allow tabs only in Makefiles, Go code, or data tables where alignment is semantically significant.
- **Automation:** Add `.editorconfig` plus formatter scripts so no human commits whitespace manually.

### Example `.editorconfig`

```ini
root = true

[*]
indent_style = space
indent_size = 2
insert_final_newline = true
trim_trailing_whitespace = true

[*.go]
indent_style = tab
indent_size = 4

[Makefile]
indent_style = tab

[*.md]
trim_trailing_whitespace = false
```

## Migration Playbook for Legacy Repositories

1. **Pick a formatter** that understands your language (Prettier, rustfmt, clang-format, etc.).
2. **Generate a baseline diff** on the main branch and tag it `style-migration-base` so future blame sessions have a checkpoint.
3. **Run the formatter once** across the entire repo. Commit with a message like `chore: normalize whitespace`.
4. **Enable CI enforcement** using a lint job. Example GitHub Action:

```yaml
name: formatting
on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  prettier:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run lint:format
```

5. **Document the decision** in your engineering handbook so new hires do not resurrect the debate.

## When Tabs Are Non-Negotiable

- **Go projects** - `gofmt` outputs tabs; fighting this means maintaining a forked formatter.
- **Makefiles** - The syntax requires a literal tab for recipe lines; spaces throw runtime errors.
- **Kernel or firmware codebases** where alignment with hardware docs matters.

Use `.editorconfig` overrides so the exception lives at the file-type level rather than tribal knowledge.

## Decision Matrix for Your Team

| Constraint | Choose Spaces If... | Choose Tabs If... |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mixed language monorepo | Majority favors spaces | Majority is Go / Make |
| Contributors on screen readers | Accessibility is priority | Team can guarantee tab-friendly tooling |
| CI formatting | Formatter defaults to spaces | Formatter outputs tabs |
| Git history stability | You want consistent blame lines | Tab width differences are acceptable |

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Agree on indent size (2 vs 4) in writing.
- [ ] Commit `.editorconfig` and format scripts.
- [ ] Add a CI guard that fails on whitespace drift.
- [ ] Document exceptions (Go, Makefile) directly in the repo README.
- [ ] Run a one-time migration and tag the commit.

## TL;DR for Your Playbook

Spaces deliver predictability, accessibility, and clean diffs. Tabs remain essential in a handful of ecosystems. The most sustainable policy is to follow formatter defaults, encode the decision in automation, and never rely on individual editor settings again.

Before your next retro, copy this article into your internal wiki and make the decision explicit. The flame war ends when the lint job runs.
